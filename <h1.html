    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
    <p> The HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing  <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>
