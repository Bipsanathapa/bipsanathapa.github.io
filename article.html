            <p> The HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing  <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>

            <h2>H3: What’s the Difference Between a Heading 1 and Page Title Tags?
            </h2>
            <p>A question that we get asked a lot and can be confusing for many is “What is the difference between a Heading 1 and Page Title?” In HTML terms, a Title Tag is expressed as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and the H1 Tag is expressed as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. Both serve as titles to describe what your webpage is about.
                    
                    The main difference between the page title tag and the H1 tag is where they appear.  The page title tag is used to the purpose of the search engines and act as the hyperlink that people click on to view your page.  Page Title’s also appear in the title bar at the top of the web browser when you are reading the content. The title tags are NOT present on the actual webpage.
                     
                    The page title for the page above is “Essential Guide: Understanding Your Cat’s Food Diet | Vet Know-how". An H1 tag is what readers will see on the page. It is often in larger text (but not always) and acts as a title for the page. H1 Tags usually DO NOT appear in the Google results page.
                    
                    The Heading 1 for the same page above is “The Essential Guide To Cat Food Diets: What You Need To Know? As you can see this is different to the page title of the page</p>
